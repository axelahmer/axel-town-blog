      I'm Axel, I've got a Masters in AI and currently work as a Data Engineer within the Australian Public Service - building data assets to help inform Australian public policy. I have a double undergraduate in Computer Science & Mathematics with Mechnaical Engineering, and a recently completed Masters in Artificial Intelligence. My interests routinely change, but revolve around: combinatorics, neural networks, logic programming, cognitive science, and chess (I even worked as a chess coach for 8 years). This website exists mostly so I have a platform to share random thoughts and explain topics that interest me, I also have a few weird projects that I work on that I might find time to share. Thanks for checking this place out.
